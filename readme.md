# Zodiac-AI

- This is an long-term Aritificial Intelligence research project thai I'm working on. 
- The project is focused on developing a comprehensive AI system that can understand and analyze various aspects of human behaviour.


## Goal
- Different zodiac has different behevioural outputs in humans.
- This aspect of human behaviour is mapped as a quantifiable metric and various kinds of behaviour can be implemented in the behaviour of an AI Entity.
- Simulating various behaviours in AI can help build humanoid AI effectively. 

## Contributions
- Contributions are welcome!
